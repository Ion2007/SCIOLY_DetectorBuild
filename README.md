This is a repository of the science olympiad event Detector Build in 2022-2023. This event is temporily inactive or disontinued as of now, but if it comes back these documents will be very useful. Also this event chages on a yearly bases; however, the code and circuitry rarely stray from what is displayed here. This detector predicts the mass of an object given the pressure it reads from fsr sensor. FSR sensor is a variable resistor made of semiconductors dependendt on force applied to it. The detector here also placed 3rd in Illinois state competition.
